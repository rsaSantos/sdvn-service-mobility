# sdvn-service-mobility

This project aims to provide a platform for creating and testing mobility strategies in vehicular networks using Kubernetes (K8s) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). It allows for the management and optimization of microservices as they move across a network of vehicles.

## Status
